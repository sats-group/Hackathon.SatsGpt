This guide explains how to set up activity-based challenges in the SATS Member App using Contentful. Challenges can be regional, time-bound, and based on distance or activity count.

🔧 Step-by-Step Setup
	1.	Find the Content Type
	•	Search for: Challenge - Activities in period
	2.	Translations
	•	Add relevant translations.
	•	Click “change translation” to switch to Norwegian.
	•	Always include English.
	3.	Target Countries
	•	Select specific countries for localized challenges.
	•	If none selected, challenge is shown in all countries.
	4.	Challenge Type
	•	For distance-based: select “Distance”.
	•	For activity count: select “ActivityCount” (e.g., X activities in Y weeks).
	5.	Group Exercise Restrictions (Optional)
	•	For challenges like “Run 10 km”, restrict completion to specific group classes (e.g., only running classes).
	•	Use the group exercise types configured in Contentful.
	6.	Device Tracking Filters
	•	If using device tracking (e.g., for distance):
	•	Limit which activity types count toward the challenge.
	7.	Training Types
	•	Select which training types count.
	•	⚠️ To include device-tracked activities, you must also include “Manually Registered Activity”.
	8.	Set the Date Range
	•	Controls when the challenge appears in the app.
	9.	Configure the Rules
	•	Define periods (e.g., weeks) and goals.
	•	Example: For a 5-week span and a goal of “4 weeks”, a member can complete the challenge by working out in any 4 out of 5 weeks (e.g., weeks 1–4 or 2–5).
	10.	Complete All Required Fields
	•	Ensure all metadata and configuration values are filled in.
